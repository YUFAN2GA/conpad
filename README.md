An interactive convex hull generation app, written in Scala, using [Slinky](slinky.dev) which is in turn based on [ScalaJS](https://www.scala-js.org/)

To dev:

```
git clone
sbt dev
```
open `localhost:8080` , and changes to .scala files is hot reloadable. 

Note:
For those not familiar with ScalaJs:
